### VSCode <!-- You can keep this section as it is -->

We strongly recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the following extensions:

-   [editorconfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig) for enforcing consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs.

Open the project in VSCode, open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and search for `Preferences: Open Workspace Settings (JSON)`.

Paste the following configuration:

```json
{
    "licenser.license": "Custom",
    "licenser.author": "Explore.dev, Unipessoal Lda",
